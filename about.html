		<p>Hi, I’m Grace! My love for experience and product design began when I was 
			accepted to the emerging technologies summer program at The School of The 
			New York Times in high school. Working with my peers, I researched and designed 
			artificial intelligence chatbots and self-driving cars, all while engaging with the 
			innovative city of New York. I completely fell in love with human-centered design 
			and the intersection of technology and people. The rest was history.</p>
			<br>
		<p>Now, I’m a second-year student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor 
			studying User Experience Design. My interests reside in inclusivity and ethical 
			tech. My affinity for promoting diversity and inclusive design stems from my own 
			identity and experiences in tech. As a second-generation Middle Eastern immigrant, 
			I’ve found that my perspectives are sorely lacking in the realm of technology. True 
			representation in technology will manifest much more efficiently if the people behind 
			the scenes understand ethical concerns firsthand and can enable avenues that creatively 
			come up with solutions for disadvantaged populations.</p>
